`_drafts` by Evan Will slightly modified by ***nananja jeans*** to be an aggregrator place for my blogs. Ability to add comments in the posts is under pipeline.

Basically, `_drafts` is a list of [gists](https://gist.github.com/). 


`_drafts` is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
