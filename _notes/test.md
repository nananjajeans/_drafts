Wget is a handy commandline utility for grabbing stuff off the web. It is built into most UNIX systems. If you are on windows, install Git for Windows which comes packaged with Git Bash, a very handy UNIX terminal emulator (note: check if Git Bash has wget installed by typing wget --version. If it is not installed, check this note). Other windows options are Cygwin, MobaXterm, or Bash on Windows Subsystem.

See all the commands by typing wget --help in your terminal or visiting the man page.
